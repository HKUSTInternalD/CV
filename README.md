# CV
CV and uart comm
The source code is in openCV_for_internal\my_first_openCV.cpp.
For the CV part, I directly used BGR color space and then inRange to filter the specific color, and together with findContours, size in range to find the object. But there's still lots of noise, I'm working on it these days.
The uart comm part is almost done, but I've just got my computer from Hall VI, so it's gonna take a few more minutes.
